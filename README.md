# FriendFinder
### By Perla E. Ballesteros

###Description:
Friend Finder takes in a user's name, photo URL, and answers to ten compatibility questions. Once the user submits all fields required, the app posts this information as a JSON object. The API is accessed via an AJAX call returning the name and photo of all compatible matches in a bootstrap modal.

###Skills:
The Friend Finder application aims to further developer's newly learned skills in Node.js by working with Express-- framework for working in local server,body-parser--middleware,path module for working with files and directory paths, and Heroku--on the cloud app deployment platform.Previously mastered skills in HTML5, jQuery, and Bootstrap come together with these new sklls to develop the Friend Finder application.

###IMPROVEMENTS:
-Currently the application uses indexOf(), which only returns the first user that matches.Work on returning multiple or all matches. 
-Breakdown code into functions.
