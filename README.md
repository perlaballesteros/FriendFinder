## Description:
Friend Finder takes in a user's name, photo URL, and answers to ten compatibility questions. Once the user submits all fields required, the app posts this information as a JSON object. The API is accessed via an AJAX call returning the name and photo of all compatible matches in a bootstrap modal.

## Skills:
The Friend Finder application aims to further developer's newly learned skills in Node.js by working with:
* Express-framework for working in local server.
* body-parser- middleware,path module for working with files and directory paths.
* Heroku- on the cloud app deployment platform.Previously mastered skills in HTML5, jQuery, and Bootstrap come together with these new sklls to develop the Friend Finder application.
